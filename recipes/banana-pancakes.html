<h3> Steps to Make Banana Pancakes</h3>
<p> It really couldn't be easier to make this basic banana pancake recipe. You'll find the full recipe below, 
    but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:</p>
<ol>
    <li> Mix
        <ul>
            <li> Combine your dry ingredients (flour, sugar, salt, baking powder)
            in one bowl and your wet ingredients (egg, milk, vegetable oil, mashed bananas) 
            in another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients, 
            then stir until they're incorporated. It's OK if your batter is slightly lumpy.

    </li>
    <li> Cook
        <ul>
